# CrimeFEM: A Finite Element and Agent-Based Modeling Framework for Urban Crime Dynamics
![Demo](demo.gif)


This repository provides the code accompanying the paper:

> *A finite element framework for simulating residential burglary in realistic urban geometries*  
> (Authors, Year)

It contains:
- Two **finite element solvers (Python)** for the PDE mean-field model.
- An **agent-based model (MATLAB)** representing individual criminal motion.
- Tools for data analysis, and visualization.

---

## Model Overview
We simulate the evolution of the *attractiveness field* and *criminal density* over realistic city geometries,
derived as a mean-field limit from an underlying agent-based process.
The PDE model resembles a nonlinear Kellerâ€“Segel system with Neumann-type boundary conditions.
